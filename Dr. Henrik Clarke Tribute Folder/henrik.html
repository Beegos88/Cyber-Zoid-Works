    <p class="text-center" font-size="20px">Dr. John H. Clarke was a professor of Black and Puerto Rican Studies at Hunter College of the City University of New York from 1969 to 1986, where he served as founding chairman of the department.</p>


    <p class="black-text text-center">Historical Background:</p>
  </div>
  <div id="Unorder-list">
    <ul>
      <li>He was born John Henry Clark on January 1, 1915, in Union Springs, Alabama, the youngest child of John (a sharecropper) and Willie Ella (Mays) Clarke (a washer woman), (who died in 1922).</li>
      <li>Counter to his mother's wishes for him to become a farmer, Clarke left Georgia in 1933 by freight train and went to Harlem, New York as part of the Great Migration of rural blacks out of the South to northern cities. There he pursued scholarship
        and activism.</li>
      <li>He renamed himself as John Henrik (after rebel Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen) and added an "e" to his surname, spelling it as "Clarke."</li>
      <li>Clarke was a professor of Black and Puerto Rican Studies at Hunter College of the City University of New York from 1969 to 1986, where he served as founding chairman of the department.</li>
      <li>He also was the Carter G. Woodson Distinguished Visiting Professor of African History at Cornell Universityâ€™s Africana Studies and Research Center. Additionally, in 1968 he founded the African Heritage Studies Association and the Black Caucus
        of the African Studies Association.</li>
      <li>In its obituary of Clarke, The New York Times noted that the activist's ascension to professor emeritus at Hunter College was "unusual... without benefit of a high school diploma, let alone a Ph.D." It acknowledged that "nobody said Professor Clarke
        wasn't an academic original."</li>
      <li>In 1994, Clarke earned a doctorate from the non-accredited Pacific Western University (now California Miramar University) in Los Angeles, having earned a bachelor's degree there in 1992.</li>
      <li>By the 1920s, the Great Migration and demographic changes had led to a concentration of African Americans living in Harlem. A synergy developed among the artists, writers and musicians and many figured in the Harlem Renaissance. They began to develop
        supporting structures of study groups and informal workshops to develop newcomers and young people.</li>
      <li>Arriving in Harlem at the age of 18 in 1933, Clarke developed as a writer and lecturer during the Great Depression years. He joined study circles such as the Harlem History Club and the Harlem Writers' Workshop.</li>
      <li>He studied intermittently at New York University, Columbia University, Hunter College, the New School of Social Research and the League for Professional Writers.</li>
      <li>Becoming prominent during the Black Power movement in the 1960s, which began to advocate a kind of black nationalism, Clarke advocated for studies of the African-American experience and the place of Africans in world history. He challenged the views
        of academic historians and helped shift the way African history was studied and taught.</li>
    </ul>

  <p class="black-text text-center">Clarke was "a scholar devoted to redressing what he saw as a systematic and racist suppression and distortion of African history by traditional scholars."</p>
